# fluxette

An implementation of [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)), a game where a triple of cards have to be found. It is implemented using [react-flux](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/react-flux), a Haskell binding to react flux. It can be tested online at the [github project page](https://drever.github.io/fluxette/). (Currently it uses always the same random seed for debugging purposes).

# Getting started

The setup works analogous to the setup described in [react-flux](https://bitbucket.org/wuzzeb/react-flux).
